Top priority functions to test are functions that:
  1. deal with array indexing
    - may cause segfaults
    - may read privileged data
    - may write to process memory
  2. read data from the OpenGL context
    - require SOP checking

List of functions:
  [Legend: + = test exists, - = no test]

drawArrays
  + with vertex arrays
  + with buffers
  + with bad args
  
drawElements
  + with vertex arrays
  + with buffers
  - with bad args (oob count & offset, oob indices)

  - normal
  - with GL canvas that has a non-SOP texture uploaded
  - bad args (coords outside viewport, zero size)
